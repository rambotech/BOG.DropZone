Testing Instructions
====================

This is a console application, which is run after starting the up the drop zone web api application.
It will display its progress, and only pause for a keystroke to continue if an action fails to resolve as expected.

- Build the solution for a DEBUG target
- Open a command-line, and make the current directory BOG.DropZone/bin/debug/net5
- Execute start_me.bat

Once the application has started, make this the startup project and execute it.

When done, stop the application in the console window, and close it.
